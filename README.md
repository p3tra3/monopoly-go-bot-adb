# monopoly-go bot using adb

Automate playing Monopoly Go! using Python and adb. It doesn't need escalated privileges

The `main.py` script will launch , make sure you have adb in your "path", and add a device or an emulator it's up to you

## Todo
1. automate the map updates (Use Tesseract to read the available/needed cash)
2. Optimise the way of interacting with the game (right now it's almost random)
